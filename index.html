      <h3 class="blogpost1" id="about-me">About me</h3>
      <p class="blogpost1">I have recently graduated from Dev Academy which was a 15 week intense bootcamp course. During this course it allowed me to learn new skills as well as further develop the skills I already knew. Dev Academy also encouraged working on personal projects and group projects with class mates during the course which allowed me develop different ways to work in a team and find ways to self improve. Some skills that I have obtained is the knowledge on how to work with typescript, javascript, html, css, node and react, as well as many other things.</p>
