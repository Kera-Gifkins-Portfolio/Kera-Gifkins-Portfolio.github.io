      <p class="blogpost1">This was a project I worked in a group of 4 to make during as our final project at dev academy, it used react typescript, has log in and log out features, and is completely unique what each person sees, we implimented alot of features into this project and resolved alot of conflict along the way. We made this for people who forget what they need to do as a little checklist for what do to and whats going on, </p>
